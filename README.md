# Guess the Cards - A Fun & Fast-Paced Card Game

## 🎯 What's the Goal?

Simple: Guess as many correct poker hands as you can before time runs out!

## 🃏 How It Works

- You start with **100 seconds**—think of it as your lifeline.
- Each round, you get **5 cards** and three possible hand rankings.
- Pick the right one, and **boom!** You get **5 extra seconds**.
- Pick wrong? Well... better luck next time.
- When the clock hits **0**, it’s game over.
- At the end, you’ll see how well you did and check out past attempts.

## 🎁 Bonus: Random Laughs

- After each round, we pull a **random word** from the internet.
- Then, we throw in a **funny message** based on that word. Because why not? 😆

Give it a shot and see how sharp your poker instincts are! ♠️♥️♣️♦️
